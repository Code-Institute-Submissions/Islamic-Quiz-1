# Credits

CONTENT
- The questions used for the quiz website was taken from a folder I had saved years ago for quizzes as I organise classes weekly with other people regarding Islam. 
- So I just took some of the questions from the folder we use. I can't remember the link for it as I had created a separate older for them years ago and saved them there. 

- Template for quiz website was inspired by this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/f4fB9Xg2JEY
